# Python projects
These are python projects which I have done while interning with Codsoft as a Python programming intern.
These programs are done on Visual Studio Code and can be runned on online compiler as well.

## Tasks 
This file includes 4 python programming task which were given during internship.

### Task 1-
The provided code defines a To_Do_List class with methods to add, view, update, and delete tasks. 
The main function serves as a command-line interface allowing users to interact with the to-do list. 
Users can choose from options to perform actions such as adding tasks, viewing existing tasks, updating tasks by ID, deleting tasks by ID, or exiting the application.

### Task 2- 
This is simple calculator code.
This code defines four functions for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
It then presents a simple command-line interface for a calculator, allowing users to choose an operation and input two numbers.
Based on the selected operation, the program performs the calculation and displays the result.
If the user attempts to divide by zero, it handles this case by returning a message stating that division by zero is not allowed.

### Task 3-
This code defines a password generator.
It imports the random and string modules to generate random characters.
The generate_password function creates a password of specified length by randomly selecting characters from letters, digits, and punctuation.
The main function prompts the user to input the desired length of the password, handles invalid inputs, and finally prints the generated password.

### Task 4-
This code creates a contact book management system. 
It includes a ContactManager class with methods to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts.
The main function presents a menu interface for users to interact with the contact book, allowing them to perform actions like adding new contacts,
viewing existing contacts, searching for specific contacts by name or phone number, updating contact details, and deleting contacts. 
Overall, it provides a convenient way for users to manage their contact information.
